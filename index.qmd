Welcome to the course website for FCIT 607: Data, Methods, and Models for Future Cities! This couse is a graduate-level introduction to reproducible research, modelling, and quantitative data analysis with an emphasis on causal, probabilistic, and futures thinking. It's part of the [Master of Future Cities (MFC)](https://uwaterloo.ca/environment/graduate/future-graduate-students/programs/master-future-cities?utm_source=envgradgoogleads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=4119&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxOauBhCaARIsAEbUSQSj4EocKfVTTNc6pCwICYJRndRkEXXvTElfnG4gFBuPJLaQ8T-0eu8aApMzEALw_wcB) program offered by the [Faculty of Environment](https://uwaterloo.ca/environment/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). You can access all course materials on this site [for free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources), including the course syllabus, overviews of each learning module, lecture slides, and an open access textbook (*currently in draft form*).

You can learn a bit more about me and my approach to teaching modelling and quantiative data analysis [here](pages/about.qmd).

## The Master of Future Cities (MFC) Program

:::{.callout-note}
## The Future is Unknown
"The traditional approaches to studying, planning, managing, and visioning our cities are arguably struggling to address our challenges today and lack the capacity to critically explore and develop alternatives for a future city. There is need to move beyond the silos within cities and disciplinary boundaries to foster multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary thinking applied to urban challenges and futures."
